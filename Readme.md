# Virtual Pet Adoption Center

This is a MERN Stack Pet Adoption App and I developed this as a job Assignment test.

## Installation

I made some custom scripts for making this job easier for you.

1. Clone Project Repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjmfs/Virtual-Pet-Adoption-Center.git
```

2. Install Client site modules

```bash
npm run client-i
```

3. Install Server site modules

```bash
npm run server-i
```

You need some environment setup for server site code so follow these steps to complete.

4. create a file named .env under server directory.

```bash
cd server && touch .env
```

5. set environment variables

```bash
mongoDB:"Your_mongoDB_connection_string"
port:"port_number_for_backend"
```

Note : This command only works on linux terminal or windows git terminal. this commands not gonna work on CMD or Powershell. you need to manually setup this one if this command not work.

## Run the Project

I also made some npm scripts for making this step easier.

1. Run client site

```bash
npm run client
```

2. Run Server site

```bash
npm run server
```

Note: run this commands on project root directory.
